GlucoGuardian is a healthcare assistant app built using Native Android (Java) and Firebase that helps patients with features such as medication reminders, where patients can log their medication times and days and receive a notification once it is time to take their medication. Besides that, our second feature which is emergency assistance allows patients to input their emergency contacts and they will be directly directed to the phone app where all they need to do is press the call button instead of searching for it when in emergency. Moreover, we also have disease-specific features such as the glucose guardian which allows diabetes patients to log their blood sugar level and receive statistics based on their glucose level, and the food recommendation feature which uses rule-based to recommend food based on their 7-day average glucose level.
